# Publications

Your publications might be the most important part of your website. Hubble theme comes with a nice list of publications with built in search and filter. Also you can organize your publications to by their type \( i.e. Journal Article, Conference, Book, etc\) and also categorize them.

## BibTex Importer

You can import a list using the BibTex importer right away and then add some more information like abstract and image and build a complete page for each of your publications to give more information on your paper or book.

You can find the importer under Publications menu.

Copy and paste the BibTex or upload a txt or bib file and you are fine.
